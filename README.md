# Slope-Field-Creator
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope_field

This program takes a differential equation of the form dy/dx = _______ and creates a slope field.
The program uses matplotlib, numpy and the math class.

Differential equations must, however, be entered into the script manually as I am unable to find a way to get Python to recognize and synthesize user provided equations.

The program automatically resizes the graph window to suit the dimensions for the graph given by the user in the command line.
